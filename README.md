# Minimum-and-Maximum-Calculator

The program allows the user to enter an indefinite number of integers and, after each new numbere entered (beside the first one), the program outputs the minimum and the maximum number entered by the user.
The program stops when the user enters an invalid number (a value that is not of type int).

## Features

1. Infinite loop that shows the minimum and the maximum numbers ever entered by the user in the course of a program run.
2. The program dosn't use default values for the minimum and maximum value. After entering a first number, the program waits for the user to enter a second value and, after that, it compares the two numbers and concludes which has the minimum value and which has the maximum value.

## Future Features

- Adding a GUI.

## Runnable App:

The .jar runnable program is available for download in the repository.
